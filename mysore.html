           Mysore Palace, located in the heart of Mysuru, Karnataka, is one of India’s most magnificent royal residences and a stunning example of Indo-Saracenic architecture. Built in the early 20th century for the Wodeyar dynasty, the palace dazzles visitors with its grand domes, intricately carved arches, stained glass windows, and opulent interiors adorned with ornate ceilings, gilded pillars, and vibrant paintings. It is the centerpiece of Mysuru’s rich cultural heritage and a symbol of royal elegance.</p>
<p>
Major highlights include the Durbar Hall, Kalyana Mantapa (wedding hall) with its stained glass dome, and the palace’s impressive collection of royal artifacts. At night, the palace is illuminated with nearly 100,000 bulbs, creating a breathtaking sight, especially during the Dasara Festival when it becomes the focal point of grand processions and cultural performances.</p>
<p>
<b>Best Time to Visit:</b> October to March offers pleasant weather, and visiting during the 10-day Dasara celebrations in September/October provides a chance to see the palace in its most festive and vibrant form. The palace is open daily, and guided tours help uncover its fascinating history and architectural details.
