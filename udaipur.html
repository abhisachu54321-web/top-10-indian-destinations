            Udaipur, often called the City of Lakes, is one of Rajasthan’s most romantic destinations, famous for its shimmering lakes, royal palaces, and scenic Aravalli hills. Founded in 1559 by Maharana Udai Singh II, it served as the historic capital of the Mewar Kingdom and still reflects the grandeur of Rajput architecture and culture.</p>
<p>
The city’s crown jewel is the City Palace, a sprawling complex overlooking Lake Pichola, with its intricate balconies, courtyards, and museums. A boat ride on Lake Pichola offers stunning views of the Lake Palace and Jag Mandir, while Saheliyon Ki Bari and Fateh Sagar Lake are perfect for leisurely strolls. Udaipur is also a hub for traditional arts, crafts, and miniature paintings.</p>
<p>
<b>Best Time to Visit: </b>October to March offers pleasant weather for lake cruises and sightseeing. Visiting during the Mewar Festival in March/April allows travelers to witness vibrant processions, folk performances, and local traditions that bring the city’s heritage to life.
