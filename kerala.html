           Kerala, often called “God’s Own Country”, is a tropical paradise in southern India known for its serene backwaters, lush greenery, and rich cultural traditions. From the palm-fringed beaches of Kovalam and Varkala to the misty hills of Munnar and Wayanad, Kerala offers an incredible variety of landscapes. Its tranquil backwaters, especially in Alleppey and Kumarakom, are best explored on a traditional houseboat, gliding past paddy fields, coconut groves, and quaint villages.</p>
<p>
Popular attractions include Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary for nature lovers, Fort Kochi for colonial heritage and arts, and Athirappilly Falls, often called the “Niagara of India.” Kerala is also famous for its Ayurvedic therapies, Kathakali dance performances, and flavorful cuisine featuring fresh seafood and coconut-based curries.</p>
<p>
<b>Best Time to Visit:</b> September to March offers pleasant weather for sightseeing, beach holidays, and hill station getaways. The monsoon season (June to August) is perfect for Ayurvedic treatments and lush scenery but may limit outdoor activities. The Onam Festival in August/September is one of the best times to experience Kerala’s vibrant traditions and hospitality.
