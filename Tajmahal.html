        <p>Taj Mahal – located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh – is one of the most celebrated monuments in the world and a timeless symbol of love. Built in the 17th century by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, this white marble masterpiece is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. Its flawless symmetry, intricate marble inlay with semi-precious stones, and the way its color changes with the sunlight have mesmerized travelers for centuries. The monument is surrounded by lush Mughal gardens (Charbagh), a grand red sandstone gateway, and a long reflecting pool that perfectly frames its beauty.</p>
<p>
Visitors can admire the central dome, four elegant minarets, and the intricate calligraphy that decorates the walls. Inside the main chamber lies the cenotaph of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan, while the real graves are in a lower chamber. The Taj also offers a stunning view of the Yamuna River from its rear terrace, especially beautiful during sunrise or under a full moon.</p>
<p>
<b>Best Time to Visit: </b>October to March offers pleasant weather for sightseeing. Early mornings or late afternoons provide the best lighting and smaller crowds. The Taj Mahal is closed on Fridays, so plan accordingly. Tickets can be booked online to save time, and sunrise visits are highly recommended for a magical, crowd-free experience.
