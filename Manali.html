            Manali, nestled in the Kullu Valley of Himachal Pradesh, is one of Indiaâ€™s most popular hill stations, offering stunning Himalayan views, lush valleys, and a mix of adventure and tranquility. Known for its snow-capped peaks, apple orchards, and pine forests, Manali is a year-round destination for honeymooners, nature lovers, and thrill-seekers alike.</p>
<p>
Top attractions include Solang Valley for skiing, paragliding, and snow activities; Rohtang Pass for panoramic mountain views; and Old Manali for its laid-back cafes and rustic charm. Visitors can also explore the Hidimba Devi Temple, Manu Temple, and the hot springs at Vashisht Village. For trekkers, Manali is the gateway to famous trails like Hampta Pass and Bhrigu Lake.</p>

<b>Best Time to Visit: </b>October to February is ideal for snow lovers, while March to June offers pleasant weather for sightseeing and adventure sports. Monsoon months (July to September) bring lush greenery but also heavy rains, so travel can be tricky.
