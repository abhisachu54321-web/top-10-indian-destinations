            Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan and famously known as the Pink City, is a vibrant blend of history, architecture, and culture. Founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the city is known for its pink-painted buildings, bustling bazaars, and grand forts and palaces. Jaipur, along with Delhi and Agra, forms India’s famous Golden Triangle tourist circuit.</p>
<p>
Major attractions include the Amber Fort, a magnificent hilltop fortress with ornate courtyards and panoramic views; the City Palace with its museums and royal chambers; the honeycomb-like Hawa Mahal (Palace of Winds); and the Jantar Mantar, an astronomical observatory and UNESCO World Heritage Site. Shoppers can explore Johari Bazaar for jewelry, Tripolia Bazaar for textiles, and local markets for handicrafts.</p>
<p>
<b>Best Time to Visit: </b>October to March offers pleasant weather for sightseeing. Visiting during festivals like Teej or Jaipur Literature Festival adds extra color and energy to the city’s charm. Early mornings and late afternoons are perfect for photography, especially when the pink sandstone glows in the sunlight
