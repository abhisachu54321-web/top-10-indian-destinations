        <p>
            Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a group of pristine islands in the Bay of Bengal, are known for their turquoise waters, white sandy beaches, and vibrant coral reefs. The capital, Port Blair, is home to the historic Cellular Jail, a reminder of Indiaâ€™s freedom struggle, while islands like Havelock and Neil are perfect for diving, snorkeling, and relaxing by the sea.</p>
<p>
Adventure lovers can enjoy activities such as sea walking, kayaking through mangroves, and exploring limestone caves at Baratang. The islands also boast rich marine biodiversity, making them a paradise for underwater photography.</p>
<p>
<b>Best Time to Visit:</b> October to May offers clear skies and calm seas for water sports and beach activities. The monsoon season (June to September) brings heavy rain and rough seas, so travel is less ideal then.
